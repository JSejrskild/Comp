//To make sure you understand how Processing calculates the value of boolean expressions, work out the values of the following boolean expressions:

//5 >= 8 
// False

//(6 >= 4) && !(3 <= 3)
// False

//(6 >= 4) && !(3 < 3) 
// True

//x > 5 || x < 10  (try a variety of values if you are stumped by this one)
// True for the following: x= 6, 7, 8 , 9

//x >= 0 && x < 200
  //Assuming x is less than 0 
  //False
  //Assuming x is greater than or equal to 0 but is less than 200 
  //True
  //Assuming x is greater than or equal to 200 
  //False


//(currentSlot == 5) && !doorOpen, where doorOpen is a boolean variable. 
//You should identify the four possibilities that can occur here, depending on the values of currentSlot and doorOpen, 
//and in each case write down what this expression evaluates to. 

  //for currentSlot equals 5 and doorOpen is true 
  //False
  //for currentSlot equals 5 and doorOpen is false
  // False
  //for currentSlot does not equal 5 and doorOpen is true 
  // True
  //for currentSlot does not equal 5 and doorOpen is false
  //False
